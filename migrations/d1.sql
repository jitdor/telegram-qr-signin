-- Schema for D1LoginStore (src/stores/d1.js).
--
-- Apply to the database that BOTH halves of the flow bind: the web app that mints tokens and the
-- bot that confirms them. On Cloudflare that usually means two Workers with a D1 binding each,
-- pointing at the same database.
--
--   wrangler d1 execute <your-db> --remote --file=node_modules/telegram-qr-signin/migrations/d1.sql
--
-- Rows here are short-lived by design: one per sign-in attempt, swept a day after expiry by the
-- store's own opportunistic cleanup. Nothing in this table is a durable record of anything — the
-- session lives in a signed cookie, not here — so it can be truncated at any time and the only
-- cost is that sign-ins in flight have to be restarted.
--
-- If you renamed the table via `new D1LoginStore(db, { table: "..." })`, rename it here too.
